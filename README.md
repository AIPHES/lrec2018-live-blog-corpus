> **Abstract:** Live blogs are an increasingly popular news format to cover breaking news and live events in online journalism. Online news websites around the world are using this medium to give their readers a minute by minute update on an event. In this paper, we study an efficient way of collecting large corpora for live blog summarization. We make our corpus publicly available in order to encourage the community to advance research and replicate our results.
